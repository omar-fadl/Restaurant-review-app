#About Restaurant Review App

I am using the starter code provided by udacity for frontend web developer nanodegree .
  Restaurant Review App  is created as part of the Udacity Nanodegree. The project is divided into three stages.
  Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers
  and future proofing JavaScript code.using [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `mapboxToken:` with a token from [Mapbox-Access token](https://www.mapbox.com/help/how-access-tokens-work/) in `main.js and restaurant_info.js`. Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
#### First Stage based on :

- accessibility
- responsiveness
- offline first

#### Second Stage based on

- performance
- accessibility
- offline first with IDB


#### Third Stage  based on 

- POST requests with offline-first approach
- a form to submit data
- performance ([Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) performance >90)
